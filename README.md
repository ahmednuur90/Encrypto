# Encrypto

<p>
  This is an encryption and decryption program I made in Python using the Cryptography library.<br>
  For the front-end, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did this by using the Eel library in Python in order to connect the front and back end together. <br>
  <br>
  
  In order to add and keep track of users, I implemented SQLite to create a database, I add a user key to the database for each user. That way when they want to encrypt or decrypt a file, they don't have to worry about using the wrong key. Since it is not possible to acces a users absolute path when they input a file in HTML, I decided to allow the user to enter their own path. This is because in order to encrypt files in other directories, the cryptograpny librbary needs the absolute path.
